## Basics
Not a programmer!! I typically hack and splice other people's code into what I need. There have been a few times that I have actually encoded more than a simple "Hello, World!" program from scratch. They have not been of enough quality or purpose to warrant "git"-ing up to the internets.
## Projects
My projects will typically entail web design and minor web-development.

My first uploaded project is [Weatherapp](https://github.com/vibrantlee/weatherapp). It utilizes HTML5/CSS3 and Javascript leveraging [SimpleWeather.js](simpleweatherjs.com).
